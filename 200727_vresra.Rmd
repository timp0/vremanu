title: "Uploading VRE data for publication"
output: html_notebook

```{r, setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(Biostrings)
library(readxl)
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="D:/Dropbox (Timp Lab)/timplab_data/vremanu/200720_sra/")
```


Ok - first let's deal with the biosample metadata


```{r}
sratemplate=read_excel("Pathogen.cl.1.0.xlsx",skip=12, col_types="text")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
